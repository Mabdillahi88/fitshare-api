## User Stories

The back-end section of the FitShare project focuses on its administration side and covers the following user stories:
- **Content Management:**  
  As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit, and delete users, posts, comments, and likes, so that I can have control over the content of the application and remove any inappropriate content.
- **Achievements Management:**  
  As an admin, I want to monitor and manage user achievements, so that I can track user engagement and reward users for their activity on the platform.

#### User Model

- The User model contains information about the user. It is part of the Django AllAuth library.
- One-to-one relation with the Profile model owner field.
- ForeignKey relation with the Follower model (owner and followed fields).
- ForeignKey relation with the Post model owner field.
- ForeignKey relation with the Comment model owner field.
- ForeignKey relation with the Like model owner field.

#### Profile Model

- The Profile model contains the following fields: `owner`, `name`, `content`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `image`.
- One-to-one relation between the `owner` field and the User model `id` field.
- Default profile image is used if no image is uploaded.

#### Post Model

- The Post model contains the following fields: `owner`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `title`, `content`, `image`, and `image_filter`.
- ForeignKey relation with the Comment model `post` field.
- ForeignKey relation with the Like model `post` field.
- Includes options for image filters like `Hudson`, `Earlybird`, `Nashville`, and more.

#### Follower Model

- The Follower model contains the following fields: `owner`, `followed`, and `created_at`.
- ForeignKey relation between the `owner` field and the User model `id` field.
- ForeignKey relation between the `followed` field and the User model `id` field.
- Unique constraint ensures a user cannot follow the same user multiple times.

#### Comment Model

- The Comment model contains the following fields: `owner`, `post`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `content`.
- ForeignKey relation between the `owner` field and the User model `id` field.
- ForeignKey relation between the `post` field and the Post model `id` field.

#### Like Model

- The Like model contains the following fields: `owner`, `post`, and `created_at`.
- ForeignKey relation between the `owner` field and the User model `id` field.
- ForeignKey relation between the `post` field and the Post model `id` field.
- Unique constraint ensures a user cannot like the same post multiple times.

#### Achievement Model

- The Achievement model is a new custom model introduced to reward user engagement.
- **Fields:**
  - `user`: A ForeignKey linking the achievement to a specific User.
  - `title`: The name of the achievement (e.g., "Newbie", "Popular Post", "Comment Champion").
  - `description`: A short explanation of what the achievement represents.
  - `date_earned`: A DateTimeField that automatically records when the achievement was awarded.
- **Awarding Logic:**
  - **Newbie:** Awarded when a user creates their first post.
  - **Popular Post:** Awarded when a post receives at least 1 like or 1 comment (thresholds reduced for easier testing).
  - **Comment Champion:** Awarded when a user makes 2 or more comments.
- This model is managed automatically using Django signals, ensuring achievements are awarded based on user actions without manual intervention.
