## User Stories

The back-end section of the FitShare project focuses on its administration side and covers one user story:
- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit, and delete users, posts, comments, and likes, so that I can have control over the content of the application and remove any inappropriate content.

#### User Model

- The User model contains information about the user. It is part of the Django allauth library.
- One-to-one relation with the Profile model owner field.
- ForeignKey relation with the Follower model owner and followed fields.
- ForeignKey relation with the Post model owner field.
- ForeignKey relation with the Comment model owner field.
- ForeignKey relation with the Like model owner field.

#### Profile Model

- The Profile model contains the following fields: `owner`, `name`, `content`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `image`.
- One-to-one relation between the `owner` field and the User model `id` field.
- Default profile image is used if no image is uploaded.

#### Post Model

- The Post model contains the following fields: `owner`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `title`, `content`, `image`, and `image_filter`.
- ForeignKey relation with the Comment model `post` field.
- ForeignKey relation with the Like model `post` field.
- Includes options for image filters like `Hudson`, `Earlybird`, `Nashville`, and more.

#### Follower Model

- The Follower model contains the following fields: `owner`, `followed`, and `created_at`.
- ForeignKey relation between the `owner` field and the User model `id` field.
- ForeignKey relation between the `followed` field and the User model `id` field.
- Unique constraint ensures a user cannot follow the same user multiple times.

#### Comment Model

- The Comment model contains the following fields: `owner`, `post`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `content`.
- ForeignKey relation between the `owner` field and the User model `id` field.
- ForeignKey relation between the `post` field and the Post model `id` field.

#### Like Model

- The Like model contains the following fields: `owner`, `post`, and `created_at`.
- ForeignKey relation between the `owner` field and the User model `id` field.
- ForeignKey relation between the `post` field and the Post model `id` field.

## Validation

### PEP8 Validation
[PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) Validation Service was used to check the code for PEP8 requirements. All the code passes with no errors or warnings.

## Testing

Comprehensive testing was conducted to ensure the robustness and reliability of FitShare's functionality. The testing process included both manual and automated approaches to validate the applicationâ€™s features and user stories.

---

### Manual Testing of User Stories

The manual testing focused on verifying key functionalities of the application against the defined user stories. Each feature was rigorously tested for expected outcomes and edge cases.

**Test** | **Action** | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result**
-------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -----------------
User Management | Create, update, and delete users | Admin can manage user accounts seamlessly | Works as expected
User Permissions | Modify user permissions | Admin can update user roles and permissions | Works as expected
Profile Management | Create, update, and delete profiles | Users can manage their profiles | Works as expected
Post Management | Create, update, and delete posts | Users can manage posts | Works as expected
Comment Management | Create, update, and delete comments | Users can manage comments on posts | Works as expected
Likes | Add and remove likes | Users can like or unlike posts | Works as expected
Followers | Follow and unfollow users | Users can follow or unfollow other users | Works as expected

- **Authentication:** Only logged-in users can create, update, or delete posts, comments, likes, or follow/unfollow users.  
- **Authorization:** Users can only modify or delete their own content, maintaining user privacy and data security.
