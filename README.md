## User Stories

The back-end section of the FitShare project focuses on its administration side and covers one user story:

- One-to-one relation with the Profile model owner field.
- ForeignKey relation with the Follower model owner and followed fields.
- ForeignKey relation with the Post model owner field.
- ForeignKey relation with the Comment model owner field.
- ForeignKey relation with the Like model owner field.

#### Profile Model

- The Profile model contains the following fields: `owner`, `name`, `content`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `image`.
